PicturePerfect © Ludwig Sembach

PicturePerfect gives you great opportunities to categorize your images and quickly find the right one at every point in time. 
The true power is unleashed when you add the raw images to the database. You can always export the selected picture as a easily sharable jpg image.
Apart from the image catalog PicturePerfect includes the RawConvert. It enables you to convert a selected batch of raw images to jpg files.
