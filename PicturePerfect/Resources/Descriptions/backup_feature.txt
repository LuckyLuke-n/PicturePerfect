The automated backup for your database will occur once a day when the application is launched. You can turn this feature off if necessary.
It is highly recommended to activate the automated backup to avoid potential frustration some point in the future. To activate the backup navigate to your project folder and go to \your-project\sqlite\backup and copy the file to \your-project. Remove the existing database.sqlite and rename the backup file to database.sqlite.
